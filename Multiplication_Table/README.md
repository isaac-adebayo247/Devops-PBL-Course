## Capstone Project - Linux Shell Scripting
### Bash Script For Generating a Multiplication Table
**_Objective:_** Create a Bash script that generates a multiplication table for a number entered by the user. This project was used to practice loops, handling user input and applying conditional logic in Bash scripting.
#### Project Description
The script will prompt a user to enter a number and then ask if they prefer to see a full multiplication table from 1 to 10 or a partial table within a specified range. Based on the user's choice, the script will display the corresponding multiplication table in ascending or descending order.
#### Project Requirements
* **_User's Input for Number:_** The script will first ask the user to input a number for which the multiplication table will be generated.
  
* **_Choice of Table Range:_** Next, the user is asked if he wants a full multiplication table (1 to 10) or a partial table. If they choose partial, user is prompted to enter the start and end of the range (between 1 and 10).
  
* **_Choice of Table Display:_** The user is then prompted if he wants the multiplication table displayed in a descending or ascending order.
  
* **_Use of Loops:_** The logic was implemented to generate the multiplication table using loops. Both the list form and the C-style loops were used in the project.
  
* **_Conditional Logic:_** _if-else_ statement was used to handle the logic based on the user's choices (full vs. partial table, valid input range and order of the table).
  
* **_Input Validation:_** This project ensures that the user enters valid numbers for the multiplication table and the specified range. Provides feedback for invalid inputs and default to a full table if the range is incorrect.
  
* **_Readable Output:_** The multiplication table is displayed in a clear and readable format, adhering to the user's choice or range and order.

* **_Use of Comments:_** Comments were used explaining the purpose of different sections and any important variables or logic used. The code was neatly formatted for easy readability.
#### Project Objectices:
* Understanding how to use variables to store user inputs and use them in calculations.

* Learning the syntax and use cases of both list form and C-style for loops.

* Practice using loops to automate repetitive tasks, such as generating a multiplication table.
#### Project Outcomes:
1. Below is the output for a full multiplication table in ascending order:

5. Below is the output when an error was entered in the range, the default table was displayed
