### CapStone Project: Enhancing a Community Library Website

**Background Scenario**

You're part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the **_"Greenwood Community Library."_** The website aims to be more engaging and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: **_Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us._** Your team decides to add a **_"Book Reviews"_** section and update the **_"Events"_** page to feature upcoming community events.

You will simulate the roles of two contributors: **_"Morgan"_** and **_"Jamie"_**. Morgan will focus on adding the **_"Book Reviews"_** section, while Jamie will update the **_"Events"_** page with new community events.

### Objectives
* Practice cloning a repository and working with branches in Git.
   
* Gain experience in staging, committing and pushing changes from both developers

* Create pull requests and merge them after resolving any potential conflicts.

### Setup
1. Create a Repository on GitHub:
* Name it [**_greenwood-library-website_**](https://github.com/isaac-adebayo247/greenwood-library-website).
* Initialize it with a README.md file and clone it to your local machine.

### Tasks
1. In the main branch, using Visual Studio Code editor ensure there are files for each of the web pages.
   * [home.html](home.html)
   * [about_us.html](about_us.html)
   * [events.html](events.html)
   * [contact_us.html](contact_us.html)
2. Add any random content into each of the files.
3. Stage, commit and push the changes directly to the **_main_** branch. (The is a simulation of the team's existing code base for the website)

### Morgan's Work: Adding Book Reviews
1. Create a Branch for Morgan:
2. Switch to a new branch named **_add-book-reviews._**
3. Add a new file **_book_reviews.html_** to represent the Book Reviews Section:
4. Add a random text content into the file.
5. Stage, commit, and Push Changes with a message like **_"Add book reviews section."_**
6. Push the **_add-book-reviews_** branch to GitHub.
7. Raise a PR for Morgan's work
8. Merge Morgan's work to the **_man_** branch

### Jamie's Work: Updating Events Page
Repeat the same flow for Jamie's work on Events Page. Ensure Jamie's work is in **_update-events_** branch.
* Pull the latest changes from the main branch into the **_update-events_** before raising the PR.
